## Exciting News Coming Soon! ðŸ”œ

Hey everyone,

I'm thrilled to share some exciting news with you.  I've been working on a project that I can't wait to introduce to you all. I've been making some significant updates, and I'll be moving the project `prerequisite tree` to a this repository.

If you'd like to explore our project's earlier versions and take a look at our journey, you can find them in the [previous repository](https://github.com/AppleBoiy/prerequisite-tree-dagreD3).

The official announcement is just around the corner, and I want to make sure everything is perfect before I share it with you. I really appreciate your support and patience. Stay tuned for the upcoming announcement, where I'll provide you with all the details and show you how to get started with the latest version of my project.


Thank you for being part of this journey with me, and I'm eager to reveal everything very soon!

Warm regards,    
CJ.
