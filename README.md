**Exciting News Coming Soon! ðŸ”œ**

Hey,

I'm stoked to share some exciting news with you. I've been working on a project that I can't wait to introduce to you both. I've made some significant updates, and I'll be moving the project "prerequisite tree" to this repository.

So, what's [prerequisite-tree-dagreD3](https://github.com/AppleBoiy/prerequisite-tree-dagreD3)? It's a tool I've been working on to convert a spreadsheet of course data into a graphical representation of course prerequisites. If you want to check out our project's earlier versions and our journey, you can find them in the [previous repository](https://github.com/AppleBoiy/prerequisite-tree-dagreD3).

The official announcement is just around the corner, and I want to make sure everything is perfect before I share it with you. I really appreciate your support and patience. Stay tuned for the upcoming announcement, where I'll provide you with all the details and show you how to get started with the latest version of my project.

Thanks for being part of this journey with me, and I'm looking forward to revealing everything very soon!

Best,
CJ
