# Pre3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Tool designed to convert a course prerequisite into a graphical representation of course prerequisites tree.

## Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre3 is a tool designed to convert a course prerequisite into a graphical representation of course prerequisites tree. The tool will allow learners to visualize the prerequisites of a course in a tree format, allowing instructors and administrators to design and plan courses more effectively.

## Background and Problem Statement

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge of course prerequisites is prevalent across many universities, where students, instructors, and administrators encounter difficulties in visualizing the required prerequisites for a course. This lack of clarity hinders students' ability to effectively plan their academic trajectory, instructors' capacity to design courses seamlessly, and administrators' capability to strategically plan course offerings for upcoming semesters.

## Objective

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of this project is to design and implement a tool that will allow learners to visualize the prerequisites of a course in a tree format, allowing instructors and administrators to design and plan courses more effectively.

## Expected Deliverables

The expected deliverables for this project are as follows:

1. **User Authentication System:**
   Implementation of a secure user authentication system allowing access based on user roles (learner, instructor, administrator).

2. **Graphical Representation:** Generation of a visually appealing and informative tree format representation of course prerequisites.

3. **Search Functionality:** Inclusion of a search feature enabling users to quickly find and view the prerequisites of a specific course.

4. **User Roles and Permissions:** Definition and implementation of distinct user roles (learner, instructor, administrator) with corresponding permissions to ensure data security.

5. **Course Modification Capability:** Integration of functionality enabling instructors to modify course prerequisites in real-time with immediate graphical representation updates.
